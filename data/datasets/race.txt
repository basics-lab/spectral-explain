He had to leave home and settled down in another country. It so happened that in this village there were many shoemakers who were spending a lot of money to buy tacks for their shoes and even at times when they paid high prices they were not always able to get what they wanted, because in that part of the country there was a high demand for soldiers' shoes.\nOur young Mr. Smith, who was finding it difficult to earn his daily bread, remembered that he had learned how to make tacks and had the sudden idea of making a bargain with the shoemakers. He told them that he would make the tacks if they would help to get him settled in his workshop. The shoemakers were only too glad of the offer. And after a while, Mr. Smith found that he was soon making the finest tacks in the village.\n\"How funny it seems,\" he used to say, \"even making tacks can bring a fortune .\"", "id": "high73.txt"}

People ask for information, play games, and share hobbies. Others buy and sell products. Still others look for friendship, or even love.\nUnlike the real world, however, your knowledge about a person is limited to words on a computer screen. Identity and appearance mean very little in cyberspace. Rather, a person's thoughts--or at least the thoughts they type--are what really count. So even the shyest person can become a chat room star.\nUsually, this \"faceless\" communication doesn't create problems. Identity doesn't really matter when you're in a chat room discussing politics or hobbies. In fact, this emphasis(,) on the ideas themselves makes the Internet a great place for exciting conversation. Where else can so many people come together to chat? But some Internet users want more than just someone to chat with. They're looking for serious love relationships. Is cyberspace a good place to find love? That answer depends on whom you ask. Some of these relationships actually succeed. Others fail miserably.\nSupporters of online relationships state that the Internet allows couples to get to know each other intellectually first. Personal appearance doesn't get in the way. But critics of online relationships argue that no one can truly know another person in cyberspace. Why? Because the Internet gives users a lot of control over how others view them. Internet users can carefully craft their words to fit whatever image they want to give. And they don't have to worry about what their \"nonverbal\"  communication is doing for their image. In a sense, they're not really themselves.\nAll of this may be fine if the relationship stays in cyberspace. But not knowing a person is a big problem in a love relationship. With so many unknowns, it's easy to let one's imagination \"fill in the blanks.\" This inevitably  leads to disappointment when couples meet in person. How someone imagines an online friend is often quite more different than the real person. So, before looking for love in cyberspace, remember the advice of Internet pioneer Clifford Stoll: \"Life in the real world is far richer than anything you'll find on a computer screen.\"", "id": "high321.txt"}

Or imagine being an 11-year-old boy who is scared to go to school because an unknown bully sent him an instant message saying that he is so fat that he should kill himself. Cases such as these are happening every day, leading kids to be depressed and unable to concentrate.\nWorse yet, parents are oblivious   to what is happening. Only 15 percent of parents even know what cyber-bullying is. And anyone who thinks that their child is not a victim or a bully is probably wrong. 90 percent of middle school students have had their feelings hurt online and 75 percent have admitted to visiting a website attacking another student.\nUnlike traditional schoolyard bullying, where a bully has a name and a face, cyber-bullying gets much of its power from anonymity  . A cyber bully might design a website posting cruel remarks about a classmate and never tell anyone that he or she was the creator. The cyber-bullying also gets its power from the scope   of its audience. Within seconds, a cyber bully can send an e-mail to everyone he or she knows, inviting them to take part in an online poll   of who is the ugliest kid in their class. Victims can be picked on day and night from any place.\nThe good news is that you can help stop cyber-bullying. By making parents and educators aware of what is going on and encouraging them to take quick and strong action when cyber-bullying cases happen, you can help make technology constructive, not destructive, for young people.", "id": "high376.txt"}

The material's inventors say it has a number of possible uses and someday could provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic. The material, made from shrimp (') shells and proteins produced from silk, is called \"shrilk.\" It is thin, clear, flexible and strong.\nA major benefit of the material is its biodegradability. Plastic's toughness and flexibility represented a revolution in materials science during the 1950s and '60s. Decades later, however, plastic's very durability   is raising questions about how appropriate it is for one-time products such as plastic bags, or short-lived consumer goods, used in the home for a few years and then cast into a landfill where they will degrade for centuries. What is the point of making something that lasts 1,000 years?\nShrilk not only will degrade in a landfill, but its basic components are used as fertilizer , and so will enrich the soil.\nShrilk has great potential, the inventors said. Materials from which it is made are plentiful in nature, found in everything ranging from shrimp shells, insect bodies to living plants. That makes shrilk low cost, and its mass production possible should it be used for products demanding a lot of material.\nWork on shrilk is continuing in the lab. The inventors said the material becomes flexible when wet, so they're exploring ways to use it in wet environments. They're also developing simpler production processes, which could be used for non-medical products, like for computer cases and other products inside the home. They're even exploring combining it with other materials, like carbon fibers, to give it new properties.", "id": "high396.txt"}

He thought that although relative needs may indeed be insatiable   , this is not true of absolute needs.\nKeynes was surely correct that only a small part of total spending is decided by the desire for superiority. He was greatly mistaken, however, in seeing this desire as the only source of insatiable demands.\nDecisions to spend are also driven by ideas of quality which can influence the demands for almost all goods, including even basic goods like food. When a couple goes out for an anniversary dinner, for example, the thought of feeling superior to others probably never comes to them. Their goal is to share a special meal that stands out from other meals.\nThere are no obvious limits to the _ of demand for quality. For example, Porsche, a famous car producer, has a model which was considered perhaps the best sport car on the market Priced at over $120,000, it handles perfectly well and has great speed acceleration. But in 2004, the producer introduced some changes which made the model slightly better in handling and acceleration. People who really care about cars find these small improvements exciting. To get them, however, they must pay almost four times the price.\nBy placing the desire to be superior to others at the heart of his description of insatiable demands, Keynes actually reduced such demands. However, the desire for higher quality has no natural limits.", "id": "high479.txt"}

According to the survey made by a famous university in the USA, most people have the experience.\n\"People often lose their concentration when they are bored, of course, but also when they are engaged in challenging tasks,\" says Peter Bregman, the head of the survey. \"They sometimes have a feeling to escape from what's difficult or boring, so they jump out,\" he says. The part of the brain devoted to attention is connected to the brain's emotional center. Any strong emotion --quarrels with colleagues, problems at home --can interrupt our attention. Studies over the last decade have shown that too much work to do at a time can easily lead to distraction.\nRefocusing is hard for many people. Robert Epstein suggests the following, \"Stop and listen to some soft music for a few minutes. Find a good friend or a teacher and say out your matter on your mind. Go for a short walk or take a deep breath, where you breathe in deeply, count to five slowly, hold it and breathe out very slowly.\" This can \"blow out all the tension and the unwanted in your mind to _ your focus.\"\nTake more control by structuring your time and becoming more aware of your behaviors. \"Setting the phone alarm to go off every hour is my way of creating awareness,\" Mr. Bregman says. \"You have to inform yourself that you've lost focus in order to do something about it.\" Starting the day with a to-do list is also important, such as when to eat, when to go to the gym or take a walk.

That is the statement of researchers who have found that tapping away on a mobile phone or computer keypad or checking for electronic messages temporarily knocks up to 10 points off the user's IQ. This rate of decline in intelligence compares unfavorably with the four-point drop in IQ associated with smoking marijuana, according to British researchers, who have described the phenomenon of improved stupidity as \"infomania\". The research conducted by Hewlett Packard, the technology company, has concluded that it is mainly a problem for adult workers, especially men.\nIt is concluded that too much use of modern technology can damage a person's mind. It can cause a constant distraction of \"always on\" technology when employees should be concentrating on what they are paid to do. Infomania means that they lose concentration as their minds remain fixed in an almost permanent state of readiness to react to technology instead of focusing on the task in hand. The report also added that, in a long term, the brain will be considerably shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. At a microcellular level, the complex networks of nerve cells that make up parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences.\nToo much use of modern technology can be damaging not only to a person's mind, but to their social relationship. 1100 adults were interviewed during the research. More than 62 per cent of them admitted that they were addicted to checking their e-mails and text messages so often that they _ work-related ones even when at home or on holiday. Half said that they always responded immediately to an email and will even interrupt a meeting to do so. It is concluded that infomania is increasing stress and anxiety and affecting one's characteristics. Nine out of ten thought that colleagues who answered e-mails or messages during a face-to-face meeting were extremely rude.\nThe effects on IQ were studied by Dr Glenn Wilson, a psychologist at University of London. \"This is a very real and widespread phenomenon,\" he said. \"We have found that infomania will damage a worker's performance by reducing their mental sharpness and changing their social life.

This has turned out a whole generation of grown-ups who seldom cook a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these restaurants, then probably children would buy less take-away food.\nThere is another argument that blames parents for allowing their children to become overweight. I agree with this, because good eating habits begin early in life, long before children start to visit fast food shops. If children are given fried chicken and chocolate rather than healthy food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat, they will go for sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their lives.\nThere is a third reason for this situation. Children these days take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front of the television or their computers and play computer games. Not only is this an unhealthy pastime , it also gives them time to eat more unhealthy food.What they need is to go outside and play active games or sports.\nThe above are the main reasons for this problem, and therefore we have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as _ them away from fast food shops and bad eating habits.", "id": "high643.txt"}

Hot water was used five hundred years ago to mean being in trouble. One story says it got that meaning from the custom of throwing extremely hot water down on enemies attacking a castle.\nThat no longer happens. But we still get in hot water. When we are in hot water, we are in trouble. It can be any kind of trouble--serious or not so serious. A person who breaks a law can be in hot water with the police. A young boy can be in hot water with his mother, if he walks in the house with dirty shoes.\nBeingin deep wateris almost the same as being in hot water. When you are in deep water, you are in a difficult position.\nTo keep your head above wateris a colorful expression that means staying out of debt. A company seeks to keep its head above water during economic hard times. A man who loses his job tries to keep his head above water until he finds a new job.\nWater over the dam is another expression about a past event. It is something that is finished. It cannot be changed. The expression comes from the idea that water that has flowed over a dam cannot be brought back again.\nAnother common expression to hold water, is about the strength or weakness of an idea or opinion that you may be arguing about. It probably comes from a way of testing the condition of a container.; If it can hold water, it is strong and has no holes in it. If your argument can hold water, it is strong and does not have any holes.\nThrowing cold water also is an expression that deals with ideas or suggestions. It means to not like an idea. For example, you want to buy a new car because the old one has some problems. But your wife throws cold water on the idea, because she says a new car costs too much.", "id": "high770.txt"}

He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including \"Shanghai Bund\"(<<>> ) and \"A Better Tomorrow\". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards.\nIn 1995, he went to Hollywood.

The Chinese attempted to parachute   in the 10th century, a thousand years before we did. The Chinese did what we would today call base diving; that is, they jumped off a place that would allow them to float from a height to the ground.\nThe first person to attempt to parachute was a Frenchman named Jacques Garnerin. He jumped from his hot-air balloon at the end of the 18th century and did tricks on the way down and _ the crowds by landing safely on the ground. At the end of the 19th century, Kathie Paulus, a brave German woman, became famous for her skydiving skills.\nOnce the airplane was invented, skydiving took on a whole new form. The airplane made it possible to dive from greater heights at greater speeds, allowing for more range in the movements in the air. A woman named Tiny Broadwick became the first woman to jump from a plane in 1913 and dive free fall in 1914.\nSkydiving was not called skydiving until the middle of the 1950s, when Ronald Young invented the word. It had been called parachuting before this and was mainly used by the military   to land troops in inland locations, or for pilots to jump out of their planes when necessary. Once World War I was over, parachuting became a sport, which we now call skydiving.\nAfter World War II, this activity became more a hobby than a military action. Soldiers were trained in parachuting and enjoyed the thrill so much that they continued on for fun. From this, teams and competitions were formed. Skydiving schools appeared in the late 1950s and now it is a recognized extreme sport enjoyed by many.", "id": "high796.txt"}

But as the ice has melted, the polar bears have been forced to spend more time on land. There, they have begun to frequent beaches, feeding on the remains of whales caught by native hunters. For polar bears, this food is less nutritious than seals that they normally catch on ice sheets. The shrinking  ice has also forced more polar bears into the ocean. In the past, they only had to swim short distances between ice sheets. But as the ice has shrunk, polar bears have been forced to swim longer and longer distances in the open ocean. This poses a severe danger during rough weather, and an increasing number of drowned polar bears have been observed.\nIn Hudson Bay, the ice breaks up three weeks earlier in the spring now than it did 20 years ago. Polar bears on Hudson Bay fast  during the summer, waiting for ice to form in the fall to hunt. Every year, the summer gets longer, and the bears get skinnier.

However, many people know little else about this wonderful animal. The word cheetah probably comes from a Hindi word spotted animal. It is very similar to other cats but also has some obvious differences. Its body is much leaner than most cats and it has much longer legs.\nPeople sometimes make a cheetah a leopard because they both have spots, but in fact they are very different. A leopard is far heavier and more powerful, but also much slower. The cheetah's spots cover most of its body except for its stomach and throat. The cheetah's tail has spots and these become rings at the end of the tail.\nAn adult cheetah weighs between 35-65 kilograms and is about 80 centimeters high at the shoulder. The cheetah's head is quite small and the eyes are quite high up. A black line runs from each eye down to its mouth and makes it look a little sad. It has high shoulders that help it to walk so gracefully.\nCheetahs are very fast but they are not very strong. They are not good fighters and will run away rather than fight another animal to protect their food. If they make a kill, it is sometimes taken away from them by stronger animals such as lions and leopard. These animals will kill their young if they get the chance.

Scientists began finding infants' skills are more than they are supposed to be.\n _ \nSpeaking of music, babies can't seem to resist it. Not only are their ears turned to the beats, babies can actually dance to the music.\nTo test babies' dancing ability, the researchers played recordings of classical music, rhythmic beats and speech to infants, and recorded the results. They also invited professional dancers to analyze how well the babies matched their movements to the music. The babies moved their arms, hands, legs feet and heads in response to the music, much more than to the speech. The finding suggests this dancing ability is innate  in humans, though the researchers aren't sure why _ becomes weaker later in their life.\nLearning Quickly while Sleeping\nBabies can learn even while asleep, according to a 2011 study. In experiments with 26 sleeping infants, each just 1 to 2 days old, scientists played a musical tone followed by a puff of air to their eyes 200 times over the course of a half-hour. 124 electrodes  stuck on the head and face of each baby recorded brain activity during the experiments. The babies rapidly learned to foretell a puff of air upon hearing the tone, showing a four-time increase on average in the chances of tightening their eyelids in response to the sound by the end of the experiments.\nAs newborns spend most of their time asleep, this newfound ability might be crucial to rapidly adapting to the world around them and help to ensure their survival, researchers said.\nJudging Characters Well\nJudging another person helpful or harmful is crucial when choosing friends. And that ability starts early. Kiley Hamlin of Yale University showed both 6-and 10-month-olds a puppet  show, in which one character helped another climb a hill. In another scene a third character pushed the climber down. The little ones then got to choose which character they preferred. For both age groups, most babies chose the helper character.

The background noise of our lives was gunfire and horses'  hoofs  from \"Wagon Train\" or \"Cheyenne\", and laughter from\"I Love Lucy\", or\"Mister Ed\".After supper, we'd lie on Mom's bed and stare for hours at the TV screen.\nBut one day Mom changed our world forever. She turned off the TV. Our mother had only been able to get through third grade. But, she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time. She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books. So she came home one day, switched off the TV, sat us down and explained that her sons were going to make something of themselves. \"You boys are going to read two books every week,\" she said. \"And you're going to write a report on what you read.\"\nWe moaned(,) and complained about how unfair it was. Besides, we didn't have any books in the house other than Mom's Bible. But she explained that we would go where the books were: \"I'll drive you to the library.\"\nSo pretty soon there were these two peevish boys sitting in her white 1959 Oldsmobile on their way to Detroit Public Library.

I moved from animals to plants, and then to rocks. Between the covers of all those books were whole worlds, and I was free to go anywhere in them. Along the way a funny thing happened: I started to know things. Teachers started to notice it too. I got to the point where I couldn't wait to get home to my books.\nNow my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore.

Because they tremble at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion, they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores. Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion. When you come to think of it, only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear.\nChanging fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste. Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn. Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way, waste hours of their time altering the dresses they have. Skirts are lengthened or shortened; neck-lines are lowered or raised, and soon.\nNo one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society. Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth, comfort and durability. They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, as long as they look right. There can hardly be a man who hasn't at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day, or delicately picking her way through deep snow in high-heeled shoes.\nWhen comparing men and women in the matter of fashion, _ .

They are wrong. Everyone has imagination, but most of us,once we became adults, forget how to access it. Creativity isn't always connected with great works of art or ideas. People at work and in their free time routinely think of creative ways to solve problems. Maybe you have a goal to achieve,a tricky question to answer or you just want to expand your mind! Here are three techniques to help you.\nThis technique involves taking unrelated ideas and trying to find links between them. First,think about the problem you have to solve or the job you need to do. Then find an image,word,idea or object,for example,a candle. Write down all the ideas/words associated with candles:light,fire,matches, wax,night,silence,etc. Think of as many as you can. The next stage is to relate the ideas to the job you have to do. So imagine you want to buy a friend an original present; you could buy him tickets to a match or take him out for the night.\nImagine that normal limitations don't exist. You have as much time/space/money,etc. as you want. Think about your goal and the new possibilities. If,for example,your goal is to learn to ski, you can now practice skiing every day of your life (because you have the time and the money). Now adapt this to reality. Maybe you can practice skiing every day in December,or every Monday in January.\nLook at the situation from a different point of view. Good negotiators use this technique in business,and so do writers. Fiction writers often imagine they are the characters in their books. They ask questions: what does this character want? Why can't she get it? What changes must she make to get what she wants? What does she dream about? If your goal involves other people, put yourself \"in their shoes\".

Should laws be involved in this issue? Is it unfair to ban sales of fur, but not sales of leather and hides  ?\nAnimals Do Not Have Rights\nBy Tibor R. Machan\nMy view is that animals do not have basic rights. It is a matter of ethics   and not of the laws of human societies. If animals had such rights as human beings do, they would have to be held responsible for killing fellow animals in the wild. That way of thinking about animals makes a category mistake. Using animals, including their fur or organs, to improve people's lives is acceptable.\nA Small Step Against Cruelty\nBy Kate Carter\nBoth fur and leather are the skins of dead animals. Why should we think that the lovable furry ones deserve more of a life than the less pleasing ones? Some say leather is  less cruel because it's a byproduct   of the meat industry. But this isn't really true. Some cheap leather may be a byproduct of the meat industry, but often it's the other way round. In South Africa, where there is a developing market for ostrich farms, the skins account for roughly 80 percent of the slaughtered  birds' value, a mere 20 percent of which comes from the meat.\n\"Who\" Are You Wearing?\nBy Marc Bekoff\nWest Hollywood's ban is a move in the right direction. However, we must work to ban the sales of leather and hides, too. Furs come from animals who are attacked to become clothing, while some leather and hides come from slaughterhouse  animals. We must remember that when people choose to wear fur, leather and hides, they are wearing formering conscious beings. So it's a matter of who they are wearing, not what they are wearing because these animals must be referred to as who and not what or that.", "id": "high1072.txt"}

These moving lights are not, in fact, stars at all. They are small pieces of matter from outer space, which burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere. The correct name of them is meteoroids. Any pieces that make it to the Earth's surface without completely burning up are known as meteorites. A meteor is actually the name given to the light we see when a meteoroid is burning up.\nWhen a meteorite hits the Earth at speeds between 11 and 72 kilometers a second, it can do amazing damage. A very large meteorite could knock the earth out of its orbit. If this happened, all life on Earth would probably become extinct . The path we follow around the Sun would change and as a result the Earth would become either much hotter or much colder. This change in temperature would affect sea levels and the amount of water in rivers. There would either be huge floods, which would cover most of the land with water, or the oceans would dry up and there would be a drought, which means a long period of time without rain. Either way, nothing could survive. If a large meteorite landed in the sea it would almost certainly cause tsunamis, which would race towards the land, destroying everything in their paths.\nAlthough it is unlikely the Earth will be struck by a meteorite large enough to do that kind of damage, there is evidence of fairly large meteorites hitting the Earth in the past. In 1908 a large area of forest in Tunguska, Siberia was destroyed by a meteorite that came apart just before it hit the ground. The moon, however, has about three billion craterscaused by meteorites impacting its surface. The reason more meteorites have reached the surface of the moon than the surface of the Earth is that the moon does not have enough atmosphere for the meteorites to burn up in. some of the meteorites that have reached the Earth's surface have done considerable damage. Some scientists believe it was a change of climate caused by meteorites hitting the Earth that resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs and other large prehistoric animals.\nScientists are especially interested in meteorites because they contain information about the solar system. It is widely believed by scientists that most meteorites are produced by collisions  between asteroids (small planets). These collisions probably happened many billions of years ago. This means the physical and chemical structure of a meteorite can give scientists information about the early days of the universe.", "id": "high1078.txt"}

He stopped by the fence in front of the house where he lived with his aunt Polly. He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down.\nHe knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire.\nHe put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets --nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea\nAt this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash.\nWhile Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said \"Ding-Dong-Dong\", \"Ding-Dong-Dong\" again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises. When he came close to Tom, he stopped.\nTom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hello! I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\"\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working.\nBen said, \"Hello, old fellow, you've got to work, hey?\"\nTom turned suddenly and said, \"Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing.\"\n\"Say --I'm going swimming. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work -- wouldn't you? Of course you would.\"\nTom looked at the boy a bit, and said \"What do you call work?\"\n\"Why, isn't that work?\"\nTom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly.\n\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\"\n\"Oh come, now, you don't mean to say that you like it?\"\nThe brush continued to move.\n\"Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\"\nBen stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said,\n\"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.\"\nTom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind.\n\"No --no --it won't do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don't think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.\"\n\"No --is that so? Oh come, now --let me just try. Only just a little.\" \"Ben, I'd like to, but if it isn't done right, I'm afraid Aunt Polly ... \"\n\"Oh, I'll be careful. Now let me try. Say --I'll give you the core of my apple.\"\n\"Well, here --No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid ...\"\n\"I'll give you all of it.\"\nTom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart.

If you go with my bicycle, you can turn on the lights.\"\nRenato, 16, spent 3 years designing his special Multibike. The device looks like a fixed exercise bike. It has wires fixed along the frame and a blender strapped (fastened) to the back. Turning the pedals operates the blender. The same principle can be used to sharpen knives or sweep city streets.\nThe Multibike can work either as a fixed bike or as a bicycle able to travel city streets and country roads. It's made from inexpensive materials, and the user gets exercise while pedaling to operate a machine.\n\"You pedal the bike, and you can mix any drink you want,\" Renato said.

You will find the object's relation to the background and other things around it has changed. The difference between these two different eye views helps us to judge how far away an object is. People who have only one eye cannot judge distance as people with two eyes.", "id": "high1438.txt"}

A dog can be a pleasant companion to your family, but if you choose the wrong kind of dog , you will have a lot of troubles.\nFamilies should sit down and discuss the possible problems before buying a dog. Even if the children in your family are the ones who want the dog, the parents are the ones who are really responsible for seeing that the animal is properly cared for. If you don't know much about dogs, it is a good idea to go to the library for books about different kinds of dogs, and books about how to train a young dog. In reading about the different breeds you should know that a dog described as very alert may be too active. When a book describes a dog as an excellent hunting dog, it probably means that the dog won't be happy living in a small house. Dog breeds vary in popularity as the years go by. One of the most popular dogs these days is the German shepherd. This is because it provides protection as well as companionship. The family should be warned that these dogs grow up to be very big, and may be too powerful for children to control. If space is limited, a toy dog may be a good choice. These dogs are very small and easy to train. They don't need to be walked daily, since they can exercise in the home.", "id": "high1446.txt"}

A certain software contains only sites that have been selected as safe. The most popular way would be to use what is known as a \"content screener\".

Another way is that mum or dad is nearby when the child is surfing the Internet.\nA few other tips:\n--Do not put the PC in a child's room but keep it in an area where mum or dad can keep an eye on things. That also makes the Internet more of a family activity.\n--Ask your child what he or she has been doing and about any friends they make on-line.\n--Tell your child not to give on-line strangers personal information, especially like address and phone number.\nAnd tell your children never to talk to anyone they meet on-line over the phone, send them anything, accept anything from them or agree to meet with them unless you go along.", "id": "high1536.txt"}

It even helps to put him in a seat next to a very popular child, or let him be a partner with that child in activities, etc.\nThere are things that parents can do at home, too.

When you plan trips, picnics, movies, and other shows, invite another child with whom your child wants to be friends.\nWhat you can do is to give him a chance to join a group that may be shutting him out.

And we've been able to record this increasing quantity of atmospheric CO2into the ocean.\nScientists expected that as atmospheric CO2increased, more and more of the carbon dioxide would be absorbed into the ocean, affecting the chemical balance of the sea water, with a potentially harmful impact on shellfish and coral in particular.\n\"As carbon dioxide dissolves  in the water, or seawater in this case, it forms a weak acid, carbonic acid,\" Dore explains. \"And therefore, as the concentration of CO2in the atmosphere goes up and that exchanges with the surface seawater, it drives the PH down, and makes it more acidic.\"\nThe seawater Dore and his colleagues have analyzed confirms what the theory predicts.\nThe effect was particular striking at about 250 meters down, and again at 500 meters.

No doubt these homes were well-built, but what these people have done is mix up the quality of material used in the house with the quality of the craftsmanship.\nHomes today could be built to last just as long as those old homes if people were willing or able to pay the price. For example, most people can no longer afford solid oak stairways, although they were once fairly common in older homes. Nor can they afford the high labor cost of employing a carpenter to build the stairway. Yet if someone can pay the high cost, there are still plenty of carpenters around able to make those stairways. And not only would these carpenters know how to build them, they would probably do a better job than carpenters of old.\nOne thing the modern carpenter has which enables him to do a better job is much more advanced tools. Such tools as laser beams and powerplanes help them lay out a house better and make more precision cuts on the wood. Also, it is not uncommon say more to find carpenters with college degrees and carpenters with a solid knowledge of mathematics, which would enable them to deal with more difficult house designs.\nThe problem of modern quality, then, really boils down to the problem of material, for the modern carpenter is just as able to produce craftsmanship as the carpenter of fifty years ago, but only if given proper material.", "id": "high1788.txt"}

No matter how many times the little ones stumble in their first efforts, most keep on trying, determined to master their amazing new skill. It is only several years later, many psychologists and teachers agree, that a good number of kids seem to lose their natural drive to succeed. For the parents of such kids, whose own ambition is often tied to their children's success, it can be a painful experience.\nFiguring out why _ is the first step. Assuming that a kid doesn't suffer from a learning disability, or isn't involved in some family crisis at home, many educators attribute a sudden lack of motivation to a fear of failure or classmate pressure. \"Everything is within the kids' control; their intelligence is changeable,\" says Lisa Blackwell, a research scientist at Columbia University. \"More than any teacher or workshop,\" Blackwell says, \"parents can play a key role in conveying this message to their children by praising their effort, and progress rather than emphasizing their 'smartness' or praising high performance alone. Most importantly, parents should let their kids know that mistakes are a part of learning.\"\nSome experts say our education system, with its strong emphasis on testing and separation of students into different levels of ability, also bears blame for the disappearance of drive in some kids. \"These programs shut down the motivation of all kids who aren't considered gifted and talented. They destroy their confidence,\" says Jeff Howard, a social psychologist. Howard and other educators say it's important to expose kids to a world beyond homework and tests, through volunteer work, sports, hobbies and other extracurriculum activities.\n\"The problem of the issue is that many students experience education as irrelevant to their life goals and ambitions,\" says Michael Nakkual, a Harvard education professor. The key to getting kids to aim higher at school is to free them of the idea that class work is irrelevant, to show them how doing well at school can actually help them fulfill their dreams beyond it. They need to understand that you have to learn to walk before you can run.", "id": "high1939.txt"}

At that moment, they thought, \"Young people are interested in pirate, but there is no such a chance for people to get together to share it. Why not have a day when everybody talks like a pirate?\" They decided to make September 19th the date. Since then, Baur and Summers have tried hard to promote Talk Like A Pirate Day.

In 2002, Baur and Summers sent a letter about their invented holiday to Dave Barry. This columnist really liked their idea. He promoted the holiday and made it known to more and more people. Now, it has really become an international holiday. On Talk Like A Pirate Day, you need to dress like a pirate. You should wear a big hat or maybe cover one of your eyes. You can pretend to be any kind of pirate that you can find in any story or movie.\nHaving fun and being relaxed are not the only best things about the holiday. Young people share the same interest and childhood dreams that day. That's why it is welcomed by so many people, especially young people.\nUnlike traditional holidays, International Talk Like A Pirate Day is a brand new holiday which is invented by the youth themselves and celebrated by themselves too. Because of Baur and Summers' imagination and creativity, thousands of young people's pirate dream come true. Next time, when you have a good idea, why not share it with your fiends and insist on your belief? Maybe you can create another wonderful holiday for the youth in the future.", "id": "high1945.txt"}

This homemade, creamy treat is a summertime delight for your kids and you alike.\nWhat you'll need:\n1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk; 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla  ; 6 tablespoons of rock salt; 1 small-sized plastic food storage bag; 1 gallon-sized plastic food storage bag; ice cubes.\nHow to make it:\nl Fill the large bag half full of ice, and add the rock salt. Seal the bag.\nl Put milk, vanilla, and sugar into the small bag, and seal it.\nl Place the small bag inside the large one, and seal it again carefully.\nl Shake until the mixture turns into ice cream, which takes about five minutes.\nl Wipe the top of the small bag, and then open it carefully. Enjoy!\nTips:\n1/2 cup of milk will make about one spoon of ice cream, so double the recipe if you want more. But don't increase the amount more than _ --a large amount might be too big for kids to pick up because the ice itself is heavy.\nHere is another version of the homemade ice cream recipe from another parent!\nThese are the homemade ice cream ingredients:\n1/4 teaspoon of vanilla butter and nuts; 1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk.\nThese are the other supplies:\nPlastic sandwich bag; 12 salt pellets; 1 dish of ice; large plastic bag.\nPut the ice cream ingredients in the small bag, and then put the bag, salt and ice in the big bag. Hold the bag shut and move it around on the floor for about 5 minutes.\nWhen I made ice cream at home last time, although the salt pellets didn't really dissolve   that well, I still got ice cream. It was not smooth ice cream, probably because of the low-fat milk. It was incredible that it could be ready in 5 minutes (not counting preparing the ingredients)\nNext, I changed the recipe, using a tablespoon of cocoa, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk.

As a result, fingerprints offer a most useful and _ way of identifying people. Any ridged part of the hand and the foot may be used as a means of identification, but finger impressions are usually preferred since they can be taken easily and quickly.\nFingerprints are classified in the ways: by general shapes and contours , by the finger positions of the pattern-types, and by size (often measured by counting the ridges in the loops). Every set of fingerprints has different \"ridge characteristics\" (i. e. the print of each separate finger is different from that of all the other fingers), which belong to one of four basic groups: arches, loops, whorls and composites. All fingerprints can then be divided into 1, 024 groups. By using details in the patterns above, these 1, 024 groups can be further divided into thousands of smaller groups, thus making it possible to find a particular set of fingerprints in a few minutes.", "id": "high2230.txt"}

Being able to speak but not write is like living in _ and never leaving one small room.

My task is to build fluency and accuracy while providing the opportunity in any writing activity to enhance the moral and emotional development of my students.\nOne great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.\nWriting ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done just like exercise; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise, writing skills improve quickly with writing practice daily. I often see a rise in student confidence and performance after only a few weeks of journal writing.\nExpressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole students. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and emotional lives. They build skills so that some say they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation , or the perfect love letter.

So merchants made signs with pictures or hung their tools over their doors to identify their businesses.\nIn the time of the Roman Empire, wall paintings were a popular form of advertisement. An ad for a play, or some other performance was painted on part of a building or on a wall around a city. People often advertised a house for rent or a freshwater bath in this way, too.\nToday, large wall signs are still used for outdoor advertising. But outdoor advertising is only a small fraction of the total advertising. About forty per -cent of all ads are printed in daily newspapers. Radio commercials also provide this kind of information. Some people think they are the best form of advertising because radio broadcasts reach almost everyone in a nation.\nAdvertisements in magazines and on television reach many people, too. However, usually only large companies can advertise on a national network, because TV commercials shown across the country can cost many thousands of dollars.\nThen there are ads that are almost part of daily living. If you use public transportation, you will see large printed ads, called ear cards, on buses and taxis and in trains.
