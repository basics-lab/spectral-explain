His generous donation is the same size as New York City's Central Park. It is said that it's the largest land donation to happen in the last 25 years.\nHow did he come up with this idea? For Robinson, the idea of donation came from his respect for the land and the environment. He doesn't have children to pass it onto. He hoped that someone would make full use of it, or the land would probably turn into wasteland. A green park filled with trees can at least help deal with global warming, in addition to producing fresh air.\nRobinson has lived here in a small wooden house since 1964.One room holds his bed, a few chairs and a desk.

Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and Hindi have become powerful languages, as well. As these languages become more powerful, their use as tools of business and culture increases. When this happens, hundreds of languages that are spoken by only a few people die out.\nScholars believe there are about 6,000 languages around the world, but more than half of them could die out within the next 100 years. Araki is a native language of the island of Vanuatu, located in the Pacific Ocean. It is spoken by only a few older adults, so like Catawba, Araki will soon disappear. Many languages of Ethiopia will have the same fate because each one has only a few speakers. In the Americas,100 languages also are dying out.\nRed Thunder Cloud was one of the first to recognize the threat of language death and to try to do something about it. He was not actually born into the Catawba tribe, and the language was not his mother tongue. However, he was a frequent visitor to the Catawba reservation in South Carolina, where he learned the language. The songs he sang for the Smithsonian Institution helped to make Native American music popular. Now he is gone, and the language is dead.", "id": "high16901.txt"}

Its body is much leaner than most cats and it has much longer legs.\nPeople sometimes make a cheetah a leopard because they both have spots, but in fact they are very different. A leopard is far heavier and more powerful, but also much slower. The cheetah's spots cover most of its body except for its stomach and throat.

It has high shoulders that help it to walk so gracefully.\nCheetahs are very fast but they are not very strong. They are not good fighters and will run away rather than fight another animal to protect their food.

To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n*      Falls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision  \n*      Bikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n*      Pedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior.

A certain software contains only sites that have been selected as safe. The most popular way would be to use what is known as a \"content screener\". But this can't be wholly reliable( ), and the best thing parents can do is to talk to their kids and let them know what is OK or not OK to see or do on the Internet. Another way is that mum or dad is nearby when the child is surfing the Internet.\nA few other tips:\n--Do not put the PC in a child's room but keep it in an area where mum or dad can keep an eye on things. That also makes the Internet more of a family activity.\n--Ask your child what he or she has been doing and about any friends they make on-line.\n--Tell your child not to give on-line strangers personal information, especially like address and phone number.\nAnd tell your children never to talk to anyone they meet on-line over the phone, send them anything, accept anything from them or agree to meet with them unless you go along.", "id": "high1536.txt"}

The sun shone brightly across the cool waters. We couldn't wait to get there. Suddenly, Walt shouted loudly. Elsie had run to him and was licking   his back. I immediately hid under the fence. However, when I looked up, I saw that Elsie wasn't a big mean bull at all.

Persuasion may be ethical   or unethical, selfless or selfish, inspiring or degrading. Persuaders may enlighten our minds or get our vulnerability . Ethical persuasion, however, calls on sound reasoning and is sensitive to the feelings and needs of listeners. Such persuasion can help us apply the wisdom of the past to the decisions we now must make. Therefore, the most basic part of education is learning to resist the one kind of persuasion and to encourage and practice the other.\nBeyond its personal importance to us, persuasion is necessary to society.

However, the critics say that after a long time, rent control may have negative effects. Landlords know that they cannot increase their profits . Therefore, they invest in other businesses where they can increase their profits. They do not invest in new buildings which would also be rent - controlled. As a result, new apartments are not built. Many people who need apartments cannot find any. According to the critics, the end result of rent control is a shortage of apartments in the city.\nSome theorists argue that the minimum wage law can cause problems in the same way. The government sets the minimum that an employer must pay workers. The minimum helps people who generally look for unskilled, low - paying jobs. However, if the minimum is high, employers may hire fewer workers. They will replace workers with machinery. The price, which is the wage that employers must pay, increases. Therefore, other things being equal, the number of workers that employers want decreases. Thus, critics claim, an increase in the minimum wage may cause unemployment.

Where does that come from?\nA: This expression is usually phrased as\"The opera isn't over till the fat lady sings. \"It got its start as a popular saying when it was used by a sportswriter Dan Cook in 1976 to indicate that a sporting contest wouldn't end until time was called.\nQ: What's the story of\"under the weather,\"especially when the weather's just fine?\nA: There's probably a nautical   explanation.

He only planted tomatoes.\nFor the first few years after he died, I couldn't even bear to look at anyone's garden without having strong memories pour over me like cold water from a bucket.

They realize that their future lies in their own hands. They understand that they can't control things in life, such as nature, the past and other people. At the same time, they are well aware that they can control their own thoughts and actions.

And preparations for the huge Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River began in the 1950s.\n    The Xiamen conference focused on the longest southern route, which would pass Jinmen and Penghu.\n    The first stage of the new project could be a bridge to cross the five kilometers between Xiamen and Jinmen. This would mean that travelling from Xiamen to Jinmen by car would only take five minutes.\n    The longest tunnel now being planned anywhere in the world is the 54-kilometer land tunnel to link Lyon in France with Turin in Italy. The tunnel will not be completed until 2015-2020.", "id": "high18533.txt"}

Although there is no certain way to avoid all cancers, reducing individual risk factors greatly decreases the likelihood of getting many forms of this dangerous disease.\nThe American Chemical Society estimates that smoking causes nearly 30 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States -- that is, about 166,000 cancer deaths each year. All cancer deaths caused by tobacco smoking could be prevented completely by not smoking and not using smokeless tobacco. For those who already smoke, quitting will reduce the risk of developing cancer. Studies show that after about ten years of not smoking, a past smoker's risk lowers to about the level of those who have never smoked.\nAfter quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet is the best way to lower the risk of cancer. Certain foods have been found to protect against cancer. Among these foods are cabbages, tomatoes, soy products, and foods high in vitamins A, C, and E. In addition, green and possibly black teas contain compounds that protect the body from cancer-causing substance.\nTo lower cancer risk, diets should include little or no red meat. Other foods to avoid or consume in moderation   include sugar, fat from animal products, and salt. Added fats and oils should come from vegetables, such as olives or corn, rather than from animal sources. Carbohydrates   should come from whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat bread, rather than from processed foods, such as white rice and white bread.\nThe risk of cancer of the esophagus   increases with heavy alcohol consumption, and many studies suggest that consuming alcoholic drinks increases the risk of breast cancer as well. Studies show that limiting intake to two drinks a day for men, and one drink per day for women, reduces cancer risk.\nLow levels of physical activity have been implicated   in some cancer. Moderate activity for 30 minutes a day enhances the immune system, shortens the time food takes to move through the intestines  , and changes body composition and hormone levels. Researchers are studying how these effects might lower cancer risk.", "id": "high16287.txt"}

It is argued by some applauding the recent change to reduce the importance of English in tests so that it will lead students to focus more on learning Chinese. The TV program Writing in Chinese has exposed the problem that students and the general public cannot write in Chinese as they used to do.\nSome blame the design of the curriculum for giving English an equal or greater amount of emphasis, which might have contributed to the failure in teaching Chinese. But this is probably not a fair accusation since children in English speaking countries cannot spell either.\nI doubt that studying English in itself hurts the study of Chinese. In fact, high achievers in English or another foreign language are more likely to be high achievers in Chinese. It has been proved many times in recent Chinese history that those capable of using a foreign language are also masters in their mother tongue. Qian Zhongshu, Lu Xun and Lin Yutang are just a few examples.\nAnother trend of thought for curriculum reform is related to the perception of \"worth\". It is true that English is one of the subjects that students do spend too much time on, with pitiful results. This makes some doubt if it is worth giving it priority. But this is not a sound argument either as students still need to study things that matter more to their future in spite of challenges learning English presents to them.\nImprovements in Chinese language education should not be achieved by sacrificing another important subject. There should be a robust  foreign language education program, as a foreign language improves a student's future job prospects. Bashing  English education as a waste of time or using it as a goat for failures in Chinese education are both harmful tendencies.\nTo be constructive, we ought to start a dialogue on ways to make improvements in learning outcomes so that students' time learning English is spent more effectively. There are a few things that could improve English education, such as assessment design,learner motivation and teaching style,\nI am sure there are many other areas where changes can greatly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of English learning. The public discourse at present is a little oversimplified. People are arguing for or against English having less weight in major tests, when the dialogue should be taken a step further, to the improvement of learning or teaching methods that may benefit the teaching of other subjects as well, Chinese included.", "id": "high6129.txt"}

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, US, say that this may someday be possible.\nA drug remains far off, but researchers have laid a foundation with their discovery that proteins can be removed from the brain's fear center to cut memories forever.\nPrevious research had already shown that a special behavior therapy   could cut painful memories. But relapse   was possible because the memory hadn't necessarily disappeared.\nBy looking at that process, Richard Huganir and Roger Clem, two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, discovered a \"window of vulnerability  \" when proteins are created. The proteins help signals travel within the brain as painful memories are made. Because the proteins are unstable, they can be easily removed with drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories.\nResearchers used mice to find the window, but think the process would be the same in humans. They used electric shocks to make the mice fear a certain sound. The sound triggered   the creation of the proteins, called calcium-permeable   AMPARS, which formed for a day or two in the fear centers of the mice's brains.\nThe researchers are working on ways to reopen the window by recalling   the painful memory and using drugs to remove the protein. They published their report online last month in Science Express.\nTheir research has drawn interest and concern from experts in mental healthcare.\nKate Farinholt, a mental health expert with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maryland, US, said many people suffering from a painful event might benefit from erasing a memory. \"Erasing a memory and then everything bad built on that is an amazing idea, and I can see all sorts of potential ,\" she said.\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions, too.\n\"Completely deleting a memory is a little scary.

Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate.

Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.\nStep3:\nUse communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.\nStep4:\nRespect the elders.

This difference may explain why men are more likely to suffer from stress-related disorders.\nUntil now, psychological research has maintained that both men and women have the same \"fight-or-flight\" reaction to stress. In other words, individuals either react with aggressive behavior, such as verbal or physical conflict (\"fight\"), or they react by withdrawing from the stressful situation (\"flight\"). However, the UCLA research team found that men and women have quite different biological and behavioral responses to stress. While men often react to stress in the fight-or-flight response, women often have another kind of reaction which could be called \"tend and befriend.\" That is, they often react to stressful conditions by protecting and nurturing their young (\"tend\"), and by looking for social contact and support from others - especially other females ('befriend\").\nScientists have long known that in the fight-or- flight reaction to stress, an important role is played by certain hormones  released by the body. The UCLA research team suggests that the female tend-or-befriend response is also based on a hormone. This hormone, called oxytocin, has been studied in the context of childbirth, but now it is being studied for its role in the response of both men and women to stress. The principal investigator, Dr. Shelley E. Taylor, explained that \"animals and people with high levels of oxytocin are calmer, more relaxed, more  social, and less anxious.\" While men also secrete oxytocin, its effects are reduced by male hormones.\nIn terms of everyday behavior, the UCLA study found that women are far more likely than men to seek social contact when they are feeling stressed. They may phone relatives or friends, or ask directions if they are lost.\nThe study also showed how fathers and mothers responded differently when they came home to their family after a stressful day at work. The typical father wanted to be left alone to enjoy some peace and quiet. For a typical mother, coping with a bad day at work meant focusing her attention on her children and their needs.\nThe differences in responding to stress may explain the fact that women have lower frequency of stress-related disorders such as high blood pressure or aggressive behavior. The tend-and-befriend regulatory  system may protect women against stress, and this may explain why women on average live longer than men.", "id": "high6512.txt"}

We can see its light and feel its warmth. The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. It causes the evaporation   of water from the oceans and lakes. Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food. These green plants then provide food for all organisms  on the Earth.\nMuch of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth's surface. It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere. Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere,30% is reflected by clouds or the Earth's surface. The remaining 70% warms the surface of the planet, causes water to evaporate, and provides energy for the water cycle and weather. Only a tiny part, approximately 0.023%, is actually used by green plants to produce food.\nMany gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth's surface back to the Earth. These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving. They are therefore called greenhouse gases.\nWhen sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface. For example, you've probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it. Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun, so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter. Dark-coloured surfaces, such as dark soil or forest, absorb more energy and help warm the surrounding air.", "id": "high2458.txt"}

That is the statement of researchers who have found that tapping away on a mobile phone or computer keypad or checking for electronic messages temporarily knocks up to 10 points off the user's IQ. This rate of decline in intelligence compares unfavorably with the four-point drop in IQ associated with smoking marijuana, according to British researchers, who have described the phenomenon of improved stupidity as \"infomania\". The research conducted by Hewlett Packard, the technology company, has concluded that it is mainly a problem for adult workers, especially men.\nIt is concluded that too much use of modern technology can damage a person's mind. It can cause a constant distraction of \"always on\" technology when employees should be concentrating on what they are paid to do. Infomania means that they lose concentration as their minds remain fixed in an almost permanent state of readiness to react to technology instead of focusing on the task in hand. The report also added that, in a long term, the brain will be considerably shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. At a microcellular level, the complex networks of nerve cells that make up parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences.\nToo much use of modern technology can be damaging not only to a person's mind, but to their social relationship. 1100 adults were interviewed during the research. More than 62 per cent of them admitted that they were addicted to checking their e-mails and text messages so often that they _ work-related ones even when at home or on holiday. Half said that they always responded immediately to an email and will even interrupt a meeting to do so. It is concluded that infomania is increasing stress and anxiety and affecting one's characteristics. Nine out of ten thought that colleagues who answered e-mails or messages during a face-to-face meeting were extremely rude.\nThe effects on IQ were studied by Dr Glenn Wilson, a psychologist at University of London. \"This is a very real and widespread phenomenon,\" he said. \"We have found that infomania will damage a worker's performance by reducing their mental sharpness and changing their social life.

Not only are their ears turned to the beats, babies can actually dance to the music.\nTo test babies' dancing ability, the researchers played recordings of classical music, rhythmic beats and speech to infants, and recorded the results. They also invited professional dancers to analyze how well the babies matched their movements to the music. The babies moved their arms, hands, legs feet and heads in response to the music, much more than to the speech. The finding suggests this dancing ability is innate  in humans, though the researchers aren't sure why _ becomes weaker later in their life.\nLearning Quickly while Sleeping\nBabies can learn even while asleep, according to a 2011 study. In experiments with 26 sleeping infants, each just 1 to 2 days old, scientists played a musical tone followed by a puff of air to their eyes 200 times over the course of a half-hour. 124 electrodes  stuck on the head and face of each baby recorded brain activity during the experiments. The babies rapidly learned to foretell a puff of air upon hearing the tone, showing a four-time increase on average in the chances of tightening their eyelids in response to the sound by the end of the experiments.\nAs newborns spend most of their time asleep, this newfound ability might be crucial to rapidly adapting to the world around them and help to ensure their survival, researchers said.\nJudging Characters Well\nJudging another person helpful or harmful is crucial when choosing friends. And that ability starts early. Kiley Hamlin of Yale University showed both 6-and 10-month-olds a puppet  show, in which one character helped another climb a hill.

Every developing economist knows it. The World Bank knows it. The education of girls is the surest way to reduce poverty.\nThe reason is simple. All the evidence shows that taking girls out of the fields and homes, and putting them behind desks, raises economic productivity, lowers infant and maternal  death rates, reduces birth rates, and improves environmental management.\nWhy, then, are 90 million primary school-age girls around the world not in school? For the same reason that when Charles Dickens was writing David Copperfield 150 years ago girls were absent from the British education system: Men in power mostly prefer _ that way, or are not interested enough in changing the situation to commit energy and money to doing so.\nThe countries with the poorest record for having women in positions of power or influence have the worst figures for girls' education. High-profile intervention  by organizations such as the World Bank has begun successfully with several countries, and more of the same will probably be needed to bring change in conservative, male-run states.\nEven if there were no development payoff from gender equality in schools, the education of girls would still be a cause worth fighting for. Education is a human right, and the denial of it to girls is a scar on the community in the twenty-first century.\nTo be born a girl in a rural area in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Togo, or Sudan -- half a dozen of the most shameful performers -- means being condemned to a life without school, education, or clean water, marriage and babies coming too early, too many births, children who die of preventable diseases, backbreaking work in the fields, subordination  to husband and his family, and an early death.\nEvery year, almost 12 million children under the age of five needlessly die of infectious diseases associated with poverty. But each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. In Pakistan, an extra year of school for 1,000 girls could prevent sixty infant deaths.\nWith women and girls being the main farmers in Africa and southern Asia, their education offers a chance to develop more efficient farming practices, improve output, and raise awareness of the ecological needs of the land with tree planting and farming.

It was quite right to compare demographic growth to \"a long, thin powder fuse that bums steadily and hesitatingly until it finally reaches the charge and explodes\".\nTo understand the current situation, which is characterized by rapid increases in population, it is necessary to understand the history of population trends. Rapid growth is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Looking back at the 8,000 years of demographic history, we find that populations have been virtually stable or growing very slightly for most of human history. For most of our ancestors, life was hard, often nasty, and very short. There was high fertility in most places, but this was usually balanced by high mortality. For most of human history, it was seldom the case that one in ten persons would live past forty, while infancy and childhood were especially risky periods. Often, societies were in clear danger of extinction because death rates could exceed their birthrates. Thus, the population problem throughout most of history was how to prevent extinction of the human race.\nThis pattern is important to notice. Not only does it put the current problems of demographic growth into a historical perspective, but it suggests that the cause of rapid increase in population in recent years is not a sudden\nenthusiasm for more children, but an improvement in the conditions that traditionally have caused high mortality.\nDemographic history can be divided into two major periods: a time of long, slow growth which extended from about 8000 B.C. till approximately 1650 A.D. In the first period of some 9,600 years, the population increased from some 8 million to 500 million in 1650. Between 1650 and 1975, the population has increased from 500 million to more than 4 billion. And the population reached 6.2 billion throughout the world by the year 2000, One way to appreciate this dramatic difference in such abstract numbers is to reduce the time frame to something that is more manageable. Between 8000 B.C. and 1650, an average of only 50,000 persons was being added annually to the world's population, At present, this number is added every six hours. The increase is about 800000,000 persons annually.", "id": "high10733.txt"}

If you have the right kind of job or go to the right social gatherings, then you receive the insincere approval of others. This means that your self-esteem  is always at the mercy of others, with no appreciation of you as an individual.\nA life, on the other hand, is very different. A life is what you lead when you know what matters most to you. It is very simple and comes from being connected to what you know is important and being willing to put that first, no matter what others may think. When you create a life vs. a lifestyle, your self-esteem comes from what's inside you, not what others think about you.\nLifestyle is expensive financially and personally, because it costs a great deal to keep up appearances and do what you think is socially acceptable. A life is not expensive. Rather than using personal or financial resources, a life generates energy and staying power. It's about liberating yourself from the mindless consumption that society expects. It is about making the choices that are in line with your values, instead of using up your bank account or energy for no heart-driven reason.\nHow can you make the change? Understand the difference between a life and a lifestyle. Analyze your current lifestyle to see what is costing you in money, time, stress, and energy to maintain it.

The people were part of the ten-year research project.

The company pays no federal, state or local taxes; pays no vehicle fees; and is free from many regulations on other businesses. Despite these advantages, the USPS has lost $52 billion since 2007, and will continue losing money without major reforms.\nThe problem is that Congress is preventing the USPS from reducing costs as its sales decline, and is blocking efforts to end Saturday service and close unneeded post office locations. USPS also has a costly union-dominated workforce that slows the introduction of new ideas or methods down. USPS workers earn significantly higher payment than comparable private-sector workers. The answer is to privatize the USPS and open postal markets to competition. With the rise of the Internet, the argument that mail is a natural monopoly that needs government protection is weaker than ever.\nOther countries facing declining letter amounts have made reforms Germany and the Netherlands privatized their national postal companies over a decade ago, and other European countries have followed suit. Britain floated shares of the Royal Mail on its stock exchange in 2013. Some countries, such us Sweden and New Zealand, have not privatized their national postal companies, but they have opened them up to competition.\nThese reforms have driven efficiency improvements in all of these countries.

Also, note that cost-cutting measures--such as closing tone post offices--are good for both the economy and the environment.\nPrivatization and competition also encourage new changes.

In 1950, he and two other men developed the teleprompter. One co-worker, Fred Barton, was an actor. He had an idea for a tool that would help television actors read their lines without having to memorize them. The other co-worker was Irving Kahn. He worked as vice-president of radio and television at 20thCentury Fox.\nThe first teleprompter involved a person who held a long piece of paper printed with big letters. As the actor read the lines, another person would move the paper ahead on the device . The teleprompter was first used on a television program called \"The First Hundred Years.\" Later versions used television screens to show the words that were to be read.\nHub Schlafly and his co-workers believed that many companies would want to buy the teleprompter. So, they left their jobs and created the TelePrompTer Corporation to sell their invention.\nIn 1952, former President Herbert Hoover became the first politician to use a teleprompter. The former president was speaking at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, USA. For a brief time, he stopped reading and began to talk about a subject not written in his speech. When Hoover wanted to continue the speech, the words on the teleprompter were not moving. He then said the machine should be restarted and viewers became aware of the new invention. Many reporters wrote about that incident, creating a new level of publicity for the teleprompter.\nSoon more and more politicians started to use it to face the television camera while reading prepared statements, instead of looking down at their notes. Then the device was used for almost all live television broadcasts.", "id": "high21712.txt"}

We just mean that it's common for older people to become a little shorter over time. This kind of shrinking can't be reversed, although people can slow or stop this process. But why does shrinking happen at all?\nBecause of gravity (the force that keeps your feet on the ground) , cushions between the bones in the spine  , get compressed  , which makes a person lose a little height and become shorter.\nAnother reason why some older people shrink is because of osteoporosis  . Osteoporosis occurs when bone is broken down and not enough new bone material is made. Over time, bone is said to be lost because it's not being replaced. Bones become smaller and weaker and can easily break if someone with osteoporosis is injured.\nOlder people--especially women, who generally have smaller and lighter bones to begin with--are more likely to develop osteoporosis. As years go by, a person with osteoporosis can get small breaks in bones that are called compression fractures . These breaks cause collapse of the spine and over time the person with osteoporosis can become hunched over  .\nDid you know that every day you shrink a little, too? You aren't as tall at the end of the day as you are at the beginning. That's because as the day goes on, water in the disks of the spine gets compressed due to gravity, making you just a tiny bit shorter. Don't worry, though.

The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree.\nOn the other hand, there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can deal with, and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old gap that white --collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true. The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen.\nThe reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree. Parents begin indoctrinating  their children with this myth before they are out of grade school. High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college, so of course they must go.

The book sold poorly.\nMelville's next book, Pierre, was almost completely disregarded by the public. Debt frustration and ill health finally forced Melville to take a low-paying job as a customs inspector. Eventually, Melville abandoned prose  and began to write poetry.\nThe Civil War is the main subject of Melville's poetry. He and his brother made a trip to the front line, and he published a book of poems, Battle-Pieces and Aspects of War, based on this experience.\nMelville died in 1891 at the age of 72. at this point, his work had been completely forgotten by the public.

It may be walking, cycling or swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some kind, football, hockey, golf, or tennis, it may be mountaineering.\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountaineering? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no manmade rules, as there are for such game as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind, which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from manmade rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"game\". We would be mistaken in this assumption. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nThe mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical capacities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve in skill year after year. A skier is probably past his prime by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties. But it is not unusual for a man of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in the Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they probably climb with more skill and less wasted effort, and they certainly experience enjoyment.", "id": "high8629.txt"}

Also, if you put too much water in the pan, it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery. If you put too little water in and let it get dry, you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables.\n*Steaming Pan\nThis is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled steamers, which sits on the oven ring. The brand I bought is called Nutritious Living.\nAdvantages: This is an excellent steamer, lightweight, easy to clean, and of all the steamers I've tried, this cooks the fastest. Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top. It's easier to store.\nDisadvantages: Water can boil away until the pan is dry, but if you make sure you fill the pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food, this should not happen.You cannot see the food cooking from the top. It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice.\nFor serious users of steamers, I recommend having one of each version.

Some adults question if high school students should have jobs. \nSome people worry that teens with after-school jobs will struggle to find time for homework. Actually, the responsibility of having a job helps teens prioritize their time. Many jobs take only a couple of  hour shifts on weeknights. According to a survey, 86 percent of high school students have an after-school, weekend or summer job and students who work between 10 and 20 hours per week during the school year have statistically higher grades-point averages than those who do not work at all. Those who work in high school are more likely to work in college, and financing their college education is a top reason for undergraduates to look for employment. Instead of considering jobs a barrier, employment should be looked at as real-world education. \nOther people think that work adds too much stress, which may be somewhat true, but regardless of having a job or not, there is always going to be stress. Better to learn how to deal with busy schedules in a controlled environment like high school than to be out on your own and alone, experiencing stress for the first time. I personally would be more concerned for the teenager who has to become independent without having any familiarity with working.\nThe biggest reason teens should be allowed to work is that it is a healthy way of earning money. My dad told me, \"Having a job is a good way to save up for things you are going to need or want to do. You get a lot more out of things if you are financially responsible for them.\" Kids need the freedom to choose how to spend their money.

He allowed her to set up her own group, which was called the Missionaries of Charity .\nShe no longer dressed as a nun in the European or Irish tradition. Instead, she put on a sari, the local dress of the Indian people. At first, people were sceptical  about her motives. Soon, they realised she was really interested in loving poor people, even those who were dying and had no chance of survival.\nSoon, other Indian people began to spare time to help Mother Teresa. She had taught everyone that the poor and dying people need love most of all.\nIn 1979, she won the Nobel Peace Prize.", "id": "high10481.txt"}

Although mayors elsewhere have been younger, Jeff Dunkel was 18 in 2001 when he was elected mayor of Mount Carbon, small towns inNew York, and elsewhere have also elected teenagers as mayors. But,Tallahassee, is the only other city with a population over 100,000 that has had a mayor as young as Mr. Ravenstahl. A supporter of Mr. Ravenstahl said concerns about Mr. Ravenstahl's age would _ once the city saw his work ethic.\nBut now comes the hard part. As he strives to be taken seriously and take charge of a city only recently back from the brink of bankruptcy, the baby-faced mayor said that even the smallest decisions felt weighty, even what to wear in the Steelers game matters.\nAnd another pressing issue is to strengthen the city's economy. Pittsburghhas lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. \"ButPittsburghhas 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.\" He said.\nBut one of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. According to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. Some city lawyers, however, have argued that he must face the electorate next year. And residents in Pittsburghare still withholding judgment on him. Deli, Jimmy Cvetic, a sandwich shop owner, said \"I call him Cool Hand Luke. He'll be all right, but he's going to need a cool hand to get through this.\"\nMayor Ravenstahl said he was still coming to terms with the challenge he faced.", "id": "high24095.txt"}

A good deal depends, of course, on the meaning of \"future\". If one is thinking in terms of science fiction and the space age, it is at least possible to assume that man will have solved such trivial and earthly problems as housing. Writers of science fiction, from H.G. Wells onwards, have had little to say on the subject. They have conveyed the suggestion that men will live in great comfort, with every imaginable apparatus  to make life smooth, healthy and easy, if not happy. But they have not said what his house will be made of. Perhaps some new building material, as yet unimagined, will have been discovered or invented at least. One may be certain that bricks and mortar(,) will long have gone out of fashion.\nBut the problems of the next generation or two can more readily be imagined. Scientists have already pointed out that unless something is done either to restrict the world's rapid growth in population or to discover and develop new sources of food (or both), millions of people will be dying of starvation or at the best suffering from underfeeding before this century is out. But nobody has yet worked out any plan for housing these growing populations. Admittedly the worst situations will occur in the hottest parts of the world, where housing can be light structure or in backward areas where standards are traditionally low. But even the minimum shelter requires materials of some kind and in the teeming, bulging towns the low-standard \"housing\" of flattened petrol cans and dirty canvas is far more wasteful of ground space than can be tolerated.\nSince the war, Hong Kong has suffered the kind of crisis which is likely to arise in many other places during the next generation. Literally millions of refugees arrived to swell the already growing population and emergency steps had to be taken rapidly to prevent squalor and disease and the spread crime. The city is tackling the situation energetically and enormous blocks of tenements are rising at an astonishing aped. But Hong Kong is only one small part of what will certainly become a vast problem and not merely a housing problem, because when population grows at this rate there are accompanying problems of education, transport, hospital services, drainage, water supply and so on. Not every area may give the same resources as Hong Kong to draw upon and the search for quicker and cheaper methods of construction must never stop.", "id": "high12137.txt"}

A very common attitude among people who are successful is that their success lies in their ability to provide themselves goals that are both numerous and exciting. When you think about your future,you are helping to feed a long-term goal of what you want to create.\nTo realize your dreams,you must translate your vision into a series of actions you can take as soon as possible. You should be able to measure these results,to make sure they take you wherever you want. And this step should not be viewed lightly! Indeed,very few people set goals and concrete actions for themselves to achieve. Very few people note what they want to accomplish,and know each day whether they have indeed advanced in the direction of their dreams.\nTherefore one of the secrets that you can get results from is to write down your goals on paper first. When you give your dreams a form,they become more concrete,and you can refer to them often and easily. Whenever you read the dreams that you note down,you fill your mind with positive and motivational thoughts.\nUnfortunately,many people stop there. They just simply make wishes, hope and wait. These people do not bring positive difference in their lives,because that sort of behavior is just wishful thinking. Success is not at all a miracle. It depends on clear and realistic targets through serious thoughts:concrete actions and perseverance . Don't forget,your past does not determine your future.

Over in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest one. Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride sends out passengers from 0-240km/h in just 4. 9 seconds. During this rapid acceleration they experience G-forces only fighter pilots usually  feel: Up to 4. 8G. The designer of several rides at Alton Towers, said: \"While we can stand 6-8Gs for very short periods of  time, ff we experience 5G for more than five seconds we're likely to \"black out.\"\nOn modern roller coasters passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops. But while we may have reached the limit in terms of G-forces, there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go---it's all down to money. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost ~18m to build.\nSome companies are finding other ways to keep us amused. There's a move towards indoor rides where the experience is improved by audio-visual technologies. For example, a company called Dynamic Structures is currently developing a \"coal-mine-themed\" ride for a client in Dubai that will combine speed and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics, which will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling.\nI can't wait to enjoy this one.

Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.\nHowever, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!\nBy the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.\nBut this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food?
